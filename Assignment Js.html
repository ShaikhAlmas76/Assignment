    <p class="q"><b>1. What is JavaScript ?</b></p>
    <p><b>Answer:</b></p>
    <p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. it is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web
        pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to intract with the user and make dynamic pages. it is an
        interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.</p>
    <p>JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript made its first appearance
        in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in
        Netscape, internet Explorer, and other web browsers.</p>
    <p>The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.</p>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>JavaScript is a lightweight,interpreted programming language</li>
        <li>Designed for creating network-centric applications.</li>
        <li>Complementary to and integrated with Java.</li>
        <li>Complementary to and integrated with HTML</li>
        <li>Open and Cross-platform</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="q"><b>2. What is the use of isNaN function?</b></p>
    <p><b>Answer:</b></p>
    <p>NaN stands for Not a Number. It's a special floating point value that is used to indicate that a result is
        undefined or unrepresentable. I personality see it as the result returned in embedded systems when a sensor is
        dissconected.</p>
    <p>NaN is not less than, greater than, equal to or not equal to any numeric value It's also not equal to itself.
        that means that you can't test whether a variable contains NaN simply by testing whether it is equal to NaN. It
        can't ever be. Thus, we have the code to test for it.</p>
    <p class="q"><b>3. What is negative Infinity?</b></p>
    <p><b>Answer:</b></p>
    <p>negative Infinity is the smallest Number.</p>
    <p>On the number-line, the right of zero are positive Numbers starting from 1 and left of zero are negative Numbers
        starting from -1. if somebody ask me how far can you go right on the number line, i would say Infinity. And if
        somebody ask me how far can you go left on the number-line, i would say negative Infinity.</p>
    <p class="q"><b>4. Which company developed JavaScript?</b></p>
    <p><b>Answer:</b></p>
    <p>The first JavaScript engine was created by<i><b>Brendan Eich</b></i>at <u><b>Netscape Communications
                corporation,</b></u>for the <u><b>Netscape</b></u>Navigator Web browser.</p>
    <p class="q"><b>5. What are undeclared and undefined variables?</b></p>
    <p><b>Answer:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Undeclared</b> variable is a variable that has been declared without 'var' keyword. demoVar = 'hello
            world'</li>
        <li><b>undefined</b> is a variable that has been declared but no value exists and is a type of itself
            'undefined'.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="q"><b>6. Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?</b></p>
    <p><b>Answer:</b></p>
    <p class="q"><b>7. What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</b></p>
    <p><b>Answer:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>ViewState:</b> It is maintained at only one level that is page-level. changes made on a single page is
            not visible on other pages. information that is gathered in view state is stored for the clients only and
            cannot be transferred any other place. view state is synonymouse with serializable data only.</li>

        <ul type="square">
            <li>ViewState has a tendency for the presistence of page-instance-specific data. when view state is used,
                the values posted of a particular page persist in the browse area that the client is using and post back
                only when the entire operation is done. The data of the previous page is no longer available when
                another page is loaded. also, data is not exposed to clients. Encryption can be used for data security.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <li><b>SessionState:</b>It is maintained at session-level and data can be accessed across all pages in the web
            application. The information is stored within the server and can be accessed by any person that has access
            to the server where the information is stored.</li>

        <ul type="square">
            <li>SessionState has the tendency for the presistence of user-specific data and is maintained on the
                server-side. This data remains available until the time that the session is completed or the browser is
                closed by the user. The session state is only valid for type objects.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <p class="q"><b>8. What is = = = operator?</b></p>
    <p><b>Answer:=></b></p>
    <p>The strict equality operator (= = =) Checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result.
        Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be
        different.</p>
    <p class="q"><b>9. How can the style/class of an element be changed</b></p>
    <p><b>Answer:=></b></p>
    <p>To change the styles of all element with a specific class:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Use the querySlectorAll() method to get a collection of the elements with the specific class.</li>
        <li>Use the forEach() method to iterate over the collection.</li>
        <li>On each iteration, use the style object to change the element's styles.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <li>var elem = document.getElementById('demo');</li>
        <li>elem.style.color = 'red'; And to change class you have to use classList object</li>
        <ul type="square">
            <li>var elem = document.getElementById ('demo');</li>
            <li>// Remove 'fi' class it</li>
            <li>elem.classList.remove('fi')</li>
            <li>// add 'mi' class to it</li>
            <li>elem.classList.add('mi')</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is how you can change style and class of an element from JavaScript.</p>
    </ol>
    <p class="q">10. How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</p>
    <p><b>Answer:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Syntax:</b> writeFile(path,inputData,callBackFunction)</li>
        <b>Write operation on a file:</b>
        <p>After the File System file is imported then,the writeFile() operation is called. The writeFile() method is
            JavaScript. The Syntax of this method is as follows-</p>
        <ul type="square">
            <li><b>Path -</b> The first parameter is the path of the file or the name of the file into which the input
                data is to be written.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If there is a file already, then the contents in the file are delated and the input which is given
                    by the user will get updated or if the file is not present, then the file with that will be created
                    in the given path and the input information is written into it.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>InputData -</b> The second parameter is the input data which contains the data to be written in the
                file that is opened.</li>
            <li><b>callBackFunction -</b> The third parameter is the function which is the call Back Function which
                takes the error as the parameter and shows the fault if the write operation fails.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Syntax:</b> readFile(path,format,callBackFunc) Reading from the file</li>
        <p>After the File system module is imported, the Reading of the file in JavaScript can be done by using the
            readFile() function.</p>
        <ul type="square">
            <li>Path - The first parameter is the path of the test file form which the contents are to read. if the
                current location or directory is the same directory where the file which is to be opened and read is
                located then, only the file name has to be given.</li>
            <li>Format - The second parameter is the optional parameter which is the format of the text file. The format
                can be ASCLL, utf-8 etc.</li>
            <li>callBackFunc - The third parameter is the call back function which takes the error as the parameter and
                displays the fault is any raised due to the error.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <p class="q">11. What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</p>
    <p><b>Answer:=></b></p>
    <p>Following are looping structures in JavaScript:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>For loop</li>
        <li>While loop</li>
        <li>Do-while loop</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="q">12. How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</p>
    <p><b>Answer:=></b></p>
    <p>In JavaScript parselnt() function (or a method) Is used to convert the passed in strint parameter or value to an
        integer value itself. this function retuns an integer of base which is specified in second argument of
        parselnt() function. parselnt() function retuns Nan(not a number) when the srting doesn't contain number.</p>
    <p><b>Syntax</b> parselnt(Value,radix) It accepts string as a value and converts it to specified radix system (any
        desired numerical value passed by a user) and retuns an integer (corresponding to the passed in numerical radix
        value).</p>

    <p class="q">13. What is the fuction of the delete operator?</p>
    <p><b>Answer:=></b></p>
    <p>Delete operator:
        Use the DELETE function to erase the data contents of a specified field, value, or subvalue and its
        corresponding delimiter from a dynamic array. The DELETE function returns the contents of the dynamic array with
        the specified data removed without changing the actual value of the dynamic array.</p>

    <p class="q">14. What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?</p>
    <p><b>Answer:=></b></p>
    <p>JavaScript has three kind of popup boxes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Alert box</li>
        <li>confirm box</li>
        <li>prompt box</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="q">15. What is the use of Void (0)?</p>
    <p><b>Answer:=></b></p>
    <p>Usually, when the user clicks a link on a page a new page loads, but this is not always the desired course of
        action. for example, when the user clicks a link on a page, you might want to update the value of a field in a
        form or the value of a variable. to prevent a page from reloading when a link is clicked, the void(0) function
        is used.</p>
    <b>Example:</b>
    <p>&lt;a href=""onclick="alert('you have clicked the button')>Click here!
        &lt;/a&gt;</p>
    <p>Click on the above link. Even though the code within it specifies to display a message in an alert box (and this
        action does take place),the page will reload automatically.</p>
    <p>We can fix this with void(0):</p>
    <p>&lt;a href="javascript:void (0);"onclick="alert ('you have clicked the button')> click here! &lt;/a&gt;</p>
    <p class="q">16. How can a page be forced to load another page in javascript?</p>
    <p><b>Answer:=></b></p>
    <p>In this artical, we will see hove can a page be forced to load another page in javascript.</p>
    <p><b>Approach:</b> We can use window.location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another page in
        javascript. it is a reference to a location object that is it represents the current location of the document.
        we can change the URL of a window by accessing it.</p>
    <p>Syntax:</p>
    &lt;script&gt;
    <p>window.location = &lt;path /URL&gt;</p>
    &lt;/script&gt;
    <p>Example:</p>
    &lt;script&gt;
    <p>"https://www.google.com/"</p>
    &lt;/script&gt;
    <p>So in the above example, we see that by changing the window.location object inside javascript we can change the
        URL of our window.location and thus successfully load any page forcibly from our javascript without any href
        tag. we will build a small working sample to learn it practically.</p>
    <p class="q">17. What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in javascript?</p>
    <p><b>Answer:=></b></p>
    <p>The use of <b>innerHTML</b> very slow: The process of using innerHTML is much slower as its contents as slowly
        built,also already parsed contents and elements are also re-parsed which takes time.</p>
    <p>preserves event handlers attached to any DOM elements: The event handlers do not get attached to the new elements
        created by setting innerHTML automatically. to do so one has to keep track of the event handlers and attach it
        to new elements manually. This may cause a memory leak on some browsers.</p>
    <p>content is replaced everywhere: Either you add, append, delete or modify contents on a webpage using innerHTML,
        all contents is replaced, also all the DOM nodes inside that element are reparsed and recreated.</p>
    <p>Appending to innerHTML is not supported: Usually, += is used for appending in JavaScript. But on appending to an
        Html tag using innerHTML, the whole tag is re-parsed.</p>
    Example:

    &lt;p&gt; id="xyz"> ABC &lt;/p&gt;
    title = document.getElementById('#xyz')

    <p>// The whole "ABC" tag is reparsed
        title.innerHTML += '&lt;p&gt;example&lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <p><b>Old content replaced issue:</b> The old content is replaced even if object.innerHTML = object.innerHTML +
        'html' is used instead of object.innerHTML += 'html'. There is no way of appending without reparsing the whole
        innerHTML. Therefore, working with innerHTML becomes very slow. String concatenation just does not scale when
        dynamic DOM elements need to be created as the plus' and quote openings and closings becomes difficult to track.
    </p>
    <p><b>Can break the document:</b> There is no proper validation provided by innerHTML, so any valid HTML code can be
        used. This may break the document of JavaScript. Even broken HTML can be used, which may lead to unexpected
        problems.</p>
    <p><b>Can also be used for Cross-site Scripting(XSS):</b> The fact that innerHTML can add text and elements to the
        webpage, can easily be used by malicious users to manipulate and display undesirable or harmful elements within
        other HTML element tags. Cross-site Scripting may also lead to loss, leak and change of sensitive information.
